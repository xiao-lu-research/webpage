abstract: In political science, data with heterogeneous units are used in many
  studies, such as those involving legislative proposals in different policy
  areas, electoral choices by different types of voters, and government
  formation in varying party systems. To disentangle decision-making mechanisms
  by units, traditional discrete choice models focus exclusively on the
  conditional mean and ignore the heterogeneous effects within a population.
  This paper proposes a conditional binary quantile model that goes beyond this
  limitation to analyze discrete response data with varying alternative-specific
  features. This model offers an in-depth understanding of the relationship
  between the explanatory and response variables. Compared to conditional
  mean-based models, the conditional binary quantile model relies on weak
  distributional assumptions and is more robust to distributional
  misspecification. The model also relaxes the assumption of the independence of
  irrelevant alternatives, which is often violated in practice. The method is
  applied to a range of political studies to show the heterogeneous effects of
  explanatory variables across the conditional distribution. Substantive
  interpretations from counterfactual scenarios are used to illustrate how the
  conditional binary quantile model captures unobserved heterogeneity, which
  extant models fail to do. The results point to the risk of averaging out the
  heterogeneous effects across units by conditional mean-based models.
