abstract: We explain the referendums on British membership of the European
  Communities and European Union from a principal–agent perspective between the
  Prime Minister and the rank-and-file. We show that announcing a referendum on
  the Prime Minister’s membership proposal helps the incumbent party to win the
  general election when the rank-and-file is divided on the terms of membership.
  When the Prime Minister overcomes the rank-and-file’s mistrust of her
  effectiveness in negotiating new membership terms with other member states,
  the voters are more likely to follow her proposal. However, when intra-party
  controversies reveal principal–agent problems, the initially uninformed voters
  can learn about the dysfunctionality of the terms and are more likely to
  reject the Prime Minister’s proposal.
