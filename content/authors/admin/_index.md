My research centers on developing both theoretical and statistical models for analyzing heterogeneous and dynamic decision making process under various contexts, with a special focus on party competition, legislative decision making, and political representation and accountability of coalition governance in European countries. My research unites two strands of significant political science inquiry: the development of game theoretical models to explain dynamic strategic decisions of political actors, and the refinement of quantitative and experimental methods to better test empirical hypotheses derived from theoretical models.
